# T03.4.1_JD-DATA026_Design

## Evidence Pointer Strategy
- Every extracted invoice header field must include at least one `EvidencePointer`.
- If extraction cannot locate evidence, insert a placeholder pointer with:
  - `source = "missing"`
  - `page = None`, `line = None`
  - `text` describing the missing evidence
  - `confidence = 0.0`

## Rationale
- Preserves traceability while explicitly signaling missing provenance.
- Enables downstream review and validation workflows to flag gaps.

## Scope
Applies to invoice header fields (`vendor`, `invoice_number`, `invoice_date`, `subtotal`, `tax`, `total`) and line items where evidence is available.
