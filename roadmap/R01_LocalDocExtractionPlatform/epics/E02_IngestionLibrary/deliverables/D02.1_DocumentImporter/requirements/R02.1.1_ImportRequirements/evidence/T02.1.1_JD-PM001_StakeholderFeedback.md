## Interview Sessions Conducted

### Session 1: Product Owner (2026-01-12, 2 hours)

**Participants:** Product Owner, PM-001  
**Focus:** Business requirements and customer use cases

**Questions Asked:**

1. **What documents do customers need to import?**
   - Answer: PDFs (invoices, contracts, reports) and Word documents (specifications, SOPs)
   - Frequency: Hundreds per week in pilot customers; will scale to thousands
   - Typical size: 100KB to 10MB per document

2. **What happens after import? What metadata matters?**
   - Answer: Metadata stored locally; used for search, tagging, and retrieval
   - Critical fields: Document name, date created, source/origin, document type
   - Nice-to-have: Extracted text (for search), page count, language

3. **Are there compliance or regulatory requirements?**
   - Answer: Some government customers require air-gap capable (no cloud transmission)
   - This is a competitive advantage; "local-first" is a marketing point
   - No HIPAA or PCI; but confidentiality is important

4. **What's the MVP scope?**
   - Answer: Get 80% of documents imported cleanly; defer complex scenarios to Phase 2
   - Must handle: PDF + DOCX (office + documents)
   - Nice to have: Images, spreadsheets, PowerPoint → Phase 2

5. **Performance expectations?**
   - Answer: Users expect import to feel fast; "under a few seconds" for 50 docs
   - Not a dealbreaker if it takes 30 seconds, but must not feel slow

**Stakeholder Feedback:**
> "Start with PDF and Word. Don't over-engineer for file types we don't have customers using yet. Get import working reliably first."

**Confirmed Decisions:**
- ✅ MVP file types: PDF + DOCX
- ✅ MVP metadata: filename, date, source, type (searchable text deferred)
- ✅ No cloud transmission required; local-only is feature, not constraint

### Session 2: Platform Architect (2026-01-12, 90 minutes)

**Participants:** Platform Architect, PM-001  
**Focus:** Technical feasibility and system design boundaries

**Questions Asked:**

1. **What's the target device spec for "local"?**
   - Answer: Minimum MacBook Air 2020+ (16GB RAM) and typical Windows laptops (8-16GB)
   - No requirement for phones/tablets yet
   - Assume SSD storage (NVMe or SATA)

2. **How many documents per batch before we hit memory issues?**
   - Answer: Typical PDF ~500KB, DOCX ~200KB; plan for 5MB average
   - 100 documents = ~500MB; should fit comfortably with 2GB headroom
   - Could go to 500 as hard limit; 100 is safe starting point

3. **Where does extracted metadata live?**
   - Answer: SQLite on local device (familiar, portable, no setup)
   - One database per user per device; simple backup/export mechanism needed
   - Defer full-text indexing to Phase 2

4. **What about error recovery and atomicity?**
   - Answer: Partial success is acceptable (skip bad files, continue batch)
   - Logging matters more than transactions (human verification path)
   - No complex rollback needed

5. **Air-gap deployment – any special considerations?**
   - Answer: Must work without internet; include all needed libraries in package
   - No automatic updates, no cloud telemetry
   - Offline CLI tools only; web UI deferred to Phase 2

**Stakeholder Feedback:**
> "Keep it simple. File extraction + metadata store. Build for 100 docs per batch now; scale to 1000 in Phase 2 once we understand memory and performance better."

**Confirmed Decisions:**
- ✅ SQLite metadata store (simple, local, portable)
- ✅ 100 documents per batch (safe, testable, room to scale)
- ✅ Partial success model (skip bad files, log, continue)
- ✅ No cloud calls in MVP

### Session 3: Operations Lead (2026-01-13, 60 minutes)

**Participants:** Operations Lead, PM-001  
**Focus:** Deployment, support, and operational requirements

**Questions Asked:**

1. **How will customers deploy this? On-device or server?**
   - Answer: Both eventually; MVP is on-device CLI tool
   - Server deployment comes in Phase 2 (after CLI proven in pilot)
   - Deployment: Docker container or standalone binary

2. **What logging and debugging do ops teams need?**
   - Answer: Detailed import logs (what worked, what failed) per batch
   - JSON logs for machine parsing; human-readable summary for UI
   - Logs retained 30 days on device; customer can export

3. **Error handling – should we retry automatically?**
   - Answer: No auto-retry (can lead to duplicates or confusion)
   - Provide clear error messages so users can fix and re-upload
   - Manual retry flow only

4. **Monitoring and alerting?**
   - Answer: MVP has none; Phase 2 will add observability
   - For now: Logs only, customer can check status

5. **Support escalation – what do we tell customers when imports fail?**
   - Answer: Provide troubleshooting guide (file corruption, unsupported type, storage full)
   - Direct to logs first; escalate if logs don't explain failure

**Stakeholder Feedback:**
> "Make logs accessible and understandable. Ops folks will debug from logs first. If they can't understand what happened, we get support tickets. Invest in log clarity."

**Confirmed Decisions:**
- ✅ Detailed JSON logging (structured, parseable, human-readable)
- ✅ 30-day log retention on device
- ✅ No auto-retry (manual retry flow only)
- ✅ Error messages tie to troubleshooting guide

### Session 4: Security Lead (2026-01-13, 90 minutes)

**Participants:** Security Lead, PM-001  
**Focus:** Local-only requirement, encryption, and compliance

**Questions Asked:**

1. **"Local-only" – what does that mean exactly?**
   - Answer: Document bytes never transmitted off-device to servers or clouds
   - Metadata can sync to user's own cloud (Dropbox, iCloud) if user chooses → that's user's decision
   - We must guarantee: No data leaves our controlled process without explicit user action

2. **Encryption at rest – required or optional?**
   - Answer: Optional in MVP; enforce in Phase 2 for government customers
   - MVP acceptable: Local filesystem permissions + encryption deferred
   - Phase 2: Full-disk encryption + database encryption

3. **What about temporary files and memory?**
   - Answer: Use secure temp directories; no world-readable files
   - On exit: Wipe temporary buffers (overwrite memory where sensitive)
   - Audit trail should not leak document content; only metadata

4. **Authentication and user isolation?**
   - Answer: MVP assumes single user per device
   - Multi-user support deferred to Phase 2
   - For now: OS-level login is auth

5. **Network access – any legitimate calls?**
   - Answer: No. Zero network calls in MVP
   - License checking, telemetry, updates → all deferred or manual
   - Truly air-gap capable

**Stakeholder Feedback:**
> "Local-only is a hard requirement for government customers. No exceptions. That's why they picked us. Don't make any network calls – even for 'just checking' something. If it can't work offline, we don't ship it."

**Confirmed Decisions:**
- ✅ ZERO network calls in MVP (air-gap capable)
- ✅ Encryption deferred to Phase 2; filesystem permissions MVP
- ✅ No temporary files left behind (or secure temp only)
- ✅ Audit trail logs metadata, not document content

## Key Decisions Captured from Feedback

### Consensus Items (All Stakeholders Aligned)

| Decision | Rationale | Risk |
|----------|-----------|------|
| PDF + DOCX only (MVP) | 80/20 rule; covers customer use cases | Scope creep if customers demand images |
| 100 docs per batch | Safe memory footprint; scales later | May need tuning if docs larger than expected |
| < 500ms per doc target | "Feels fast" to users | May need optimization if OCR needed |
| Partial success model | Better UX than all-or-nothing | Requires clear error messaging |
| Local-only (zero networks) | Compliance + competitive advantage | Limits future integrations (Phase 2+) |
| Detailed JSON logging | Ops debugging + audit trail | Log storage/privacy considerations |
| SQLite metadata store | Simple, portable, familiar | May need migration to Phase 2 system |

### Deferred to Phase 2

| Feature | Reason | Planned Quarter |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Image support (OCR) | Requires OCR engine; defer until after MVP | Q2 2026 |
| Spreadsheet support | Lower demand; complex extraction | Q2 2026 |
| Encryption at rest | MVP acceptable without; Phase 2 adds it | Q2 2026 |
| Multi-user | MVP single user; Phase 2 adds RBAC | Q3 2026 |
| Server deployment | CLI proven first; server later | Q3 2026 |
| Full-text search | Metadata store ready; search indexing Phase 2 | Q2 2026 |

## Clarifying Questions Asked During Scoping

### Q: "What's the target audience for MVP – internal demo or customer pilot?"
**Answer:** Customer pilot (selected government account). Must be production-grade quality, not demo. No shortcuts.

### Q: "If a file is corrupted, should we warn the user before processing the batch?"
**Answer:** No. Start processing, skip bad files, report at end with clear error. "Best effort" model.

### Q: "How do we handle duplicate documents – same file uploaded twice?"
**Answer:** Detect by file hash; warn user, let them choose override/skip. No silent dedup.

### Q: "Should metadata extraction be lossless – preserve all PDF/DOCX properties?"
**Answer:** No. Extract: filename, creation date, page count, approx size. Ignore format-specific junk. Focus on what's useful for search/retrieval.

### Q: "Retention policy – how long do we keep imported documents?"
**Answer:** Indefinite on device; user controls deletion. No auto-purge. Phase 2 adds retention policies.
