### Report Example 2 (Edge Case – Security Audit Report)

**Input Document:**
```
SECURITY AUDIT REPORT
DocExtractor Platform - Penetration Testing Results

Engagement Period: January 1-15, 2025
Scope: Cloud API, web application, database layer
Tester: CyberSecurity Consultants LLC

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
We conducted a comprehensive penetration test of the DocExtractor platform. We identified 
7 vulnerabilities: 2 critical, 3 high, 2 medium. No critical vulnerabilities remain unfixed.

FINDINGS

Critical Vulnerabilities (2):
1. SQL Injection in search endpoint (Fixed on Jan 5)
2. Unencrypted API key in logs (Fixed on Jan 8)

High-Risk Vulnerabilities (3):
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) in document viewer
- Missing CSRF token validation
- Weak password policy enforcement

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Implement parameterized queries platform-wide (prevents SQL injection)
2. Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit
3. Add security testing to CI/CD pipeline
4. Conduct annual penetration testing

CONCLUSION
The platform has improved significantly since the last audit (6 months ago). Current 
vulnerability level is acceptable for production use with recommended fixes prioritized.

### Specification Example 2 (Edge Case – Technical Design Doc)

**Input Document:**
```
ARCHITECTURE DESIGN DOCUMENT (ADD)
DocExtractor Metadata Store - Module Design

Module: Metadata Index Service
Version: 1.0
Date: January 2025

1. PURPOSE
   The Metadata Index Service provides fast, queryable access to document metadata
   (classification, tags, import date) across the DocExtractor platform.

2. ARCHITECTURE

   Components:
   - Input Layer: REST API accepting metadata updates
   - Indexing Engine: SQLite with B-tree indices
   - Query Engine: SQL interface with prepared statements
   - Cache Layer: In-memory LRU cache for hot data

   Data Flow:
   Document → Classifier → Metadata → Index Service → Query Engine → Client

3. INTERFACES

   3.1 Ingestion Interface
   - Method: POST /metadata/index
   - Payload: {document_id, metadata_json, timestamp}
   - Response: {indexed: true, latency_ms: 24}

   3.2 Query Interface
   - Method: GET /metadata/query?filter=...
   - Query language: SQL (sandboxed, read-only)
   - Max results: 10,000

4. PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
   - Indexing latency: < 50ms per document
   - Query latency: < 100ms for common queries
   - Index size: < 20% of document storage
   - Memory usage: < 500MB for 1M documents

5. FAILURE HANDLING
   - Index corruption: Automatic rebuild from document store
   - Query timeout: Return partial results after 1s
   - Loss of cache: Graceful degradation to disk-backed queries
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
