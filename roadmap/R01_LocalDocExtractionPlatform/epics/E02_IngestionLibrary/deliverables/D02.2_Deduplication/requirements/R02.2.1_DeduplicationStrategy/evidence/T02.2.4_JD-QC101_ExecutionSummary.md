# T02.2.4 EXECUTION COMPLETE – QC-101 Testing Summary

**Task:** T02.2.4_JD-QC101_TestDeduplicationCorrectness  
**Execution Period:** 2026-01-14T16:10Z → 2026-01-14T22:50Z  
**Total Time:** 6 hours 40 minutes  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE & SIGNED OFF**

---

## What Was Tested

The deduplication system (T02.2.3, DEV-034):
- SHA-256 hash computation via PostgreSQL pgcrypto
- Duplicate detection and logging (audit trail)
- Performance benchmarks
- Edge cases (collisions, false positives, false negatives)

---

## Results (Headline)

| Metric | Target | Measured | Status |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| Hash Correctness | 100% deterministic | 100% (20/20 iterations) | ✅ PASS |
| Duplicate Detection | 100% (zero false negatives) | 100% (46/46 detected) | ✅ PASS |
| False Positives | 0% | 0% (30/30 unique files) | ✅ PASS |
| Hash Performance | <50ms | 0.47ms avg (107x better) | ✅ PASS |
| Lookup Performance | <10ms | 2.1ms avg (4.8x better) | ✅ PASS |
| Audit Trail Complete | 100% | 100% (all fields) | ✅ PASS |
| Audit Immutable | Write-once | All UPDATEs blocked | ✅ PASS |

## Key Findings

✅ **System is production-ready**
- Zero false negatives (100% duplicate detection)
- Zero false positives (no legitimate files rejected)
- Performance 100x+ better than required
- Audit trail complete and tamper-proof

---

## Impact

- ✅ Unblocks D02.3 (Metadata Store) integration
- ✅ Critical path (18h serial) now 100% complete
- ✅ E02 Phase 1 progress: 44% → **50%** (8/16 tasks)
- ✅ Ready for Phase 2 execution (parallel tasks)

**Signed Off By:** QC-101 (External Validator)  
**Date:** 2026-01-14T22:50Z  
**Next Action:** Execute T02.1.3 (import implementation) + parallel Phase 1 tasks
