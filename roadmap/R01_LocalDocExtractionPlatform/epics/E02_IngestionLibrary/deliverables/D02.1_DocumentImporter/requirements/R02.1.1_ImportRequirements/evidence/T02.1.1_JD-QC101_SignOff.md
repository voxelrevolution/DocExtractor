## Recommendations for T02.1.2 & Beyond

### For T02.1.2 (Design Phase – DEV-024)

1. Use the Acceptance Criteria document as the design requirements spec
2. Validate design against all 7 acceptance criteria
3. Pay special attention to memory constraints (100-doc batch on 8GB devices)
4. Design error handling per the partial success model

### For T02.1.3 (Implementation – DEV-024)

1. Follow design documents from T02.1.2
2. Implement all error scenarios documented in Dependencies artifact
3. Enforce zero network calls (code review gate required)
4. Implement audit logging per specification

### For T02.1.4 (Testing – QC-101)

1. Test against each of the 7 acceptance criteria
2. Test edge cases: corrupted PDFs, large batches (100 docs), storage full
3. Validate performance targets under realistic conditions
4. Verify zero network calls (network trace analysis)
