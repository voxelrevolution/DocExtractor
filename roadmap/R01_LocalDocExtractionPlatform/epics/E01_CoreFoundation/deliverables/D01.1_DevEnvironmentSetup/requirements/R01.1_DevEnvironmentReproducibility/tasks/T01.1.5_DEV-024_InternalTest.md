# T01.1.5 – Test Setup Script (Internal Validation)

## Task Context
**Assigned to:** DEV-024 (Deliverables Manager)  
**Associated Requirement:** R01.1 (Dev Environment Reproducibility)  
**Status:** Not Started  

## Task Statement
Execute and validate the setup script on at least one fresh development machine to confirm it works end-to-end. This is internal validation before external testing in T01.1.6.

## Testing Scope
- [ ] Clone repository on a fresh machine (or fresh VM)
- [ ] Follow `docs/ONBOARDING.md` exactly as written
- [ ] Run `./scripts/setup.sh` and capture all output
- [ ] Verify all smoke tests pass
- [ ] Measure total time from clone to "ready"
- [ ] Test idempotency: run setup script a second time, confirm no errors

## Test Environment
- OS: Linux (preferred for testing since production target is Linux)
- Hardware: Standard dev machine (doesn't need GPU for this test)
- Network: Normal internet access (Ollama model will be pulled)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Setup completes without errors
- [ ] All dependency checks pass
- [ ] PostgreSQL is accessible
- [ ] Ollama model is verified present
- [ ] Smoke tests pass (pytest output shows all tests green)
- [ ] Total time measured and documented (<30 minutes target)
- [ ] Second run (idempotency check) also passes
- [ ] All output captured in `setup.log`

## Documentation & Evidence
- [ ] Full `setup.log` saved to `evidence/T01.1.5_setup_log.txt`
- [ ] Screenshot or transcript of successful test run
- [ ] Timing measurements recorded
- [ ] Any issues encountered and how they were resolved documented

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All success criteria met
- [ ] Evidence artifacts stored in `evidence/T01.1.5/`
- [ ] Issues found are logged as GitHub issues or noted for T01.1.6 feedback
- [ ] DEV-024 approves and signs off

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Internal test completed successfully
- [ ] Evidence saved and reviewed
- [ ] Any setup script fixes applied (if issues found)
- [ ] Ready for external validation (T01.1.6)
- [ ] DEV-024 confirms readiness

## Related Tasks
- Depends on T01.1.2, T01.1.3, T01.1.4 being complete
- Enables T01.1.6 (external validation)
