## SECTION 2: TASK DEFINITION

### Objective

**Scope the document import system by gathering requirements from stakeholders, documenting what documents will be imported, defining constraints, and securing sponsor approval to proceed with implementation.**

### Description

The Local Document Extraction Platform needs to ingest documents locally (on-device). This task defines exactly what that means:

1. **Stakeholder Discovery** – Interview key stakeholders to understand:
   - What documents need to be imported? (file types, formats, sources)
   - What volume? (documents per batch, batch frequency, storage limits)
   - What metadata? (how are documents classified, tagged, stored?)
   - What constraints? (performance targets, compliance requirements, error handling)

2. **Define "Local Import"** – Clarify what this means in context:
   - On-device ingestion (no cloud, no external services)
   - Error handling (what happens if import fails? Retry? Rollback?)
   - Resumability (can we pause and resume large batches?)
   - Logging (what audit trail do we need?)

3. **Document Requirements** – Create comprehensive scope document:
   - File types supported (PDF, DOCX, images, etc.)
   - Batch size limits (max documents per batch)
   - Performance targets (max import time per batch)
   - Error handling strategy (failures, validation, rollback)
   - Audit/logging requirements

4. **Identify Gaps & Dependencies** – Surface blocking questions:
   - What happens with corrupted files?
   - Do we support resumable uploads?
   - What's the storage limit on local device?
   - Do we need encryption for stored documents?
   - What compliance requirements apply?

5. **Secure Sponsor Approval** – Present findings and get go/no-go decision:
   - Is scope acceptable?
   - Are constraints realistic?
   - Proceed to implementation phase?

### Assigned Role

**Role:** PM-001 (Scoping Agent)

**Non-Delegable:** This role owns the scoping decision. No hand-offs.

**Key Accountabilities:**
- Elicit complete requirements from stakeholders
- Identify architectural implications upfront
- Document acceptance criteria explicitly
- Surface blockers and dependencies
- Secure stakeholder approval before handoff

## SECTION 3: ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA & DEFINITION OF DONE

### Requirements Satisfied

- **R02.1.1 – Import Requirements** (this requirement)

### Acceptance Criteria (What Done Looks Like)

**Functional Criteria:**

1. ✅ **File Types Defined** – Documented which file types the import system will handle
   - Examples: PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, images (JPEG, PNG), text files
   - Decision: Which types are MVP vs. future?
   - Evidence: Scoping report lists supported types + rationale

2. ✅ **Batch Size Defined** – Documented max documents per batch and batch frequency
   - Decision: 100? 1000? 10000 documents per batch?
   - Decision: How frequently are batches processed?
   - Evidence: Acceptance criteria document

3. ✅ **Performance Targets Defined** – Documented acceptable import time
   - Target: <100ms per document? <1s per batch?
   - Depends on: Device specs, network, file sizes
   - Evidence: Performance targets in acceptance criteria

4. ✅ **Error Handling Strategy Defined** – Documented how system handles failures
   - Scenarios: Corrupted file, permission denied, storage full, network error
   - For each: Stop all? Skip file? Retry? Log and continue?
   - Evidence: Error handling matrix in scoping report

5. ✅ **Local-Only Constraint Confirmed** – Documented what "local" means
   - No cloud services? Confirmed.
   - No external APIs? Confirmed.
   - On-device only? Confirmed.
   - Evidence: Scoping report confirms constraint interpretation

6. ✅ **Blockers Identified** – Listed all blocking questions
   - Format: "BLOCKER: [Question]. Impact: [Why it matters]. Status: [Resolved/Unresolved]"
   - Examples: "Do we support resumable imports?" "Storage limit on device?"
   - Evidence: Dependencies document

7. ✅ **Stakeholder Alignment** – Documented that sponsor reviewed and approved
   - Who: [Stakeholder name/role]
   - When: [Date of approval meeting]
   - Decision: GO (proceed to implementation)
   - Evidence: Approval document or email

8. ✅ **QC-101 Validation** – External validator reviewed and approved
   - QC-101 confirms all 7 gates above are true
   - Creates sign-off: T02.1.1_JD-QC101_SignOff.md
   - Evidence: QC-101 sign-off file exists

**Non-Functional Criteria:**
- Documentation is clear and actionable (not ambiguous)
- Acceptance criteria are explicit (no "TBD" left)
- All stakeholder questions answered
- Next task (T02.1.2 – Design Import Engine) has clear input to start from

---

## SECTION 4: JD CONTEXT (PRELOADED)

### Role: PM-001 – Scoping Agent

**Agent ID:** PM-001

**Core Purpose:**
"Guide initial project conversations to uncover comprehensive requirements, identify critical gaps, and build out half-baked ideas into well-scoped initiatives."

### Key Responsibilities for This Task

**Requirements Elicitation:**
- Ask thoughtful, open-ended questions to uncover latent requirements
- Think architecturally across all relevant dimensions (performance, security, compliance, scalability)
- Identify gaps and categorize them:
  - **BLOCKING** – Must resolve before implementation starts
  - **RESEARCH** – Need to investigate further
  - **DESIGN_TIME** – Architect can resolve during design phase
  - **ITERATIVE** – Can defer to future releases
- Help build out half-baked ideas through exploratory dialogue

**Expected Questions to Ask:**
- "What are the different document types you need to import?"
- "How many documents do you expect to import per batch?"
- "What happens if a document can't be imported (corrupted, wrong format)?"
- "Do we need to resume interrupted imports?"
- "What's the constraint on local storage?"
- "What compliance requirements apply?"
- "How will errors be logged and tracked?"
- "Who needs visibility into import status?"

### World-Class Behaviors Expected

**For This Task (T02.1.1):**

1. **Scope is Crystal Clear**
   - No ambiguity in "what documents get imported"
   - No ambiguity in "what local-only means"
   - No ambiguity in "acceptable error rates"

2. **Scope is Achievable Within Constraints**
   - Performance targets are realistic (not "as fast as possible")
   - File types are well-defined (not "everything")
   - Error handling is explicit (not "handle all errors gracefully")

3. **Stakeholder is Aligned and Approved**
   - Sponsor has reviewed scope
   - Sponsor has signed off (go/no-go decision)
   - No surprises when implementation begins

4. **Blockers are Surfaced Early**
   - "Is resumability required?" ← Ask this now, not after design
   - "What's the device storage limit?" ← Clarify now
   - "Do we support nested folder structures?" ← Decide now

5. **Next Task Knows What to Do**
   - T02.1.2 (Design Import Engine) receives clear input
   - No need to revisit "what are we building?"
   - Can immediately move to "how should we build it?"
