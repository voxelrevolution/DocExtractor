## SECTION 2: TASK DEFINITION

### Objective (One Sentence)
Design and implement table-aware line item parsing with provenance for invoice line items.

### Description
- Detect line item tables in invoices (digital or OCR text).
- Extract row/column structure for line items.
- Attach evidence spans or bounding-box references.
- Document failure modes and routing to review.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Line items extracted with stable row ordering.
- Evidence present for each line item row.
- Table detection handles multi-line descriptions.
- Failure modes documented with fallback path.

### Assigned JD Role
**Role:** DATA-026 – Document Intelligence Engineer (non-delegable)

### Dependencies (Blocking This Task)
- T03.1.1 schema definitions complete.
- OCR path functional (D03.3 prerequisites).

### Downstream Tasks (That This Unblocks)
- T03.5.1 validation checks on line items
- T03.7.1 benchmark evaluation
