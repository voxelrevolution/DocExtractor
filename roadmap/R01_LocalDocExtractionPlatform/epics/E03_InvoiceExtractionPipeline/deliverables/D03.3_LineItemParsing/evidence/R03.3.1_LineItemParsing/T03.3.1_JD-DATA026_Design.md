# T03.3.1_JD-DATA026_Design

## Line Item Parsing Strategy
- Use heuristic parsing over line-tagged text with 2+ space separation.
- Preserve input order to maintain stable row ordering.
- Attach evidence pointers per line item with line metadata.

## Failure Modes
- Lines without sufficient columns are skipped.
- Multi-line descriptions are not merged in MVP; flagged for review in future iterations.

## Evidence Requirements
Each line item includes evidence with source, page, line, text, and confidence.
