## Test Execution Checklist

**Pre-Test:**
- [ ] Environment prepared (dependencies installed)
- [ ] Test data ready (200+ mixed PDFs/DOCX, corrupted files)
- [ ] Database initialized
- [ ] Network monitoring ready (tcpdump)
- [ ] Memory monitoring ready

**During Test:**
- [ ] Execute each test case sequentially
- [ ] Document pass/fail for each
- [ ] Record timing, memory, errors
- [ ] Note any anomalies

**Post-Test:**
- [ ] Analyze results
- [ ] Create final report (T02.1.4_JD-QC101_TestResults.md)
- [ ] Issue approval or rejection

## Pass/Fail Criteria

### PASS (All of these required)
- ✅ All 18 test cases pass
- ✅ Zero critical defects
- ✅ All 10 acceptance criteria validated
- ✅ Performance ≤500ms per document
- ✅ Network audit: zero calls
- ✅ Audit logs: complete and correct

### FAIL (Any of these is failure)
- ❌ Any test case fails
- ❌ AC-8 performance >500ms per document
- ❌ AC-9 network call detected
- ❌ Data corruption or loss
- ❌ Unhandled exception
- ❌ Memory leak
