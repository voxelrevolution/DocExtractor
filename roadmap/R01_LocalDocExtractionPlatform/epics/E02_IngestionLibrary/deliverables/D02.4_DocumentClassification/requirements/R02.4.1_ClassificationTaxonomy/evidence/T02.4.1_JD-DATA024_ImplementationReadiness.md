# Implementation Readiness: Migration Plan & LLM Prompt

**Task:** T02.4.1_JD-DATA024_DefineClassificationTaxonomy  
**Evidence Artifact:** Implementation Readiness Specification  
**Created By:** DATA-024 (Ontology and Taxonomy Designer)  
**Date:** 2026-01-14

## Taxonomy Handoff Checklist

- ✅ 32 categories defined (5 domains)
- ✅ Examples and non-examples documented for all categories
- ✅ Confidence thresholds specified per category
- ✅ Ontology relationships modeled (semantic links between categories)
- ✅ Routing logic defined (category → tag mapping)
- ✅ Governance model established (owners, change process)
- ✅ Evaluation criteria specified (6 success metrics, 8-phase test plan)
- ✅ Edge case handling rules documented
- ✅ Compliance level mapping completed
- ✅ LLM prompt foundation provided (next: T02.4.2 to enhance with few-shot examples)

**Ready for:** T02.4.2 (AGENT-002 Prompt Systems Engineer) implementation

## LLM Prompt Foundation

**Base prompt for T02.4.2 implementation (starter; AGENT-002 will enhance with few-shot examples):**

```
System Prompt for Document Classification LLM:

You are an expert document classifier. Your task is to classify business documents 
into one of 32 pre-defined categories. Always respond with a structured JSON output.

Input: Document text or metadata (filename, content preview)

Task:
1. Analyze the document content and structure
2. Identify the document category from the list below
3. Assign a confidence score (0.0-1.0) representing your certainty
4. Provide brief reasoning for your classification

Output Format:
{
  "category": "<category_name>",
  "confidence": 0.XX,
  "reasoning": "<brief explanation>",
  "matching_indicators": [
    "<indicator 1>",
    "<indicator 2>"
  ]
}

Categories (32 total):
Financial (10): Invoice, Receipt, PurchaseOrder, Quote, Statement, CreditMemo, 
                DebitMemo, ExpenseReport, TaxDocument, PaymentConfirmation
Legal (8): Contract, StatementOfWork, Liability, TermsConditions, Compliance,
           IntellectualProperty, LegalNotice, RegulatoryDocument
HR (6): EmploymentContract, Payroll, PerformanceReview, Benefits, Training, Termination
Operations (5): ProjectPlan, MeetingMinutes, OrgChart, Policy, VendorDocument
Other (3): Marketing, Correspondence, Unclassifiable

Confidence Guidelines:
- 0.90-1.0: Very confident (clear examples: "Invoice" with invoice number, itemized line items)
- 0.75-0.89: Confident (good indicators but some ambiguity)
- 0.70-0.74: Possible (some matching indicators but significant ambiguity)
- Below 0.70: Unclassifiable (escalate for manual review)

Default to "Unclassifiable" if confidence < 0.70.

Examples (few-shot examples to be added in T02.4.2 by AGENT-002):
[Placeholder: 2-3 high-quality examples per category will be added in next phase]
```

**Next Phase (T02.4.2):** AGENT-002 will enhance this base prompt with:
- 2-3 few-shot examples per category (real document excerpts)
- Domain-specific context (financial vs. legal language patterns)
- Edge case handling (when to escalate for manual review)
- Output validation rules (ensure valid JSON, catch malformed responses)

---

## Integration Points (For T02.4.2 and Beyond)

**T02.4.2 Input:**
- This taxonomy JSON schema (complete category definitions, examples, confidence thresholds)
- 100 annotated sample documents (ground truth for training)
- Base prompt template (above)

**T02.4.2 Output:**
- Fine-tuned LLM classifier with prompt enhancements
- Prompt validation tests (ensure JSON output format)
- Classification accuracy metrics (baseline before deployment)

**T02.4.3 Input:**
- Trained LLM from T02.4.2
- 250 test documents (unseen)
- Evaluation test plan (from T02.4.1_EvaluationCriteria.md)

**T02.4.3 Output:**
- Classification accuracy report (should exceed 90% target)
- Edge case handling validation
- Ready for production deployment (T02.5 tagging integration)

## Database Schema Integration (D02.3)

**Taxonomy stored in:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE document_classifications (
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  doc_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES documents(id),
  category VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  confidence DECIMAL(3,2),
  model_version VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'v1.0',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(doc_id, model_version)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_category ON document_classifications(category);
CREATE INDEX idx_confidence ON document_classifications(confidence);
CREATE INDEX idx_model_version ON document_classifications(model_version);
```

**Taxonomy definition stored as JSON:**
```sql
-- Optional: Store full taxonomy JSON in config table for versioning
CREATE TABLE taxonomy_versions (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  version VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE,
  taxonomy_json JSONB NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
