# T03.1.1_JD-PM003_TestResults

## Validation Notes
- Schema draft cross-checked against implementation in `src/schemas/invoice.py` and extraction flow.
- Required fields and evidence requirements align with current extraction output.

## Acceptance Tests Defined (Specification-Level)
1. Extraction returns all required header fields with evidence pointers.
2. Line items include description, quantity, unit_price, amount (nullable where not detected).
3. Evidence pointers contain source, page, line, text, confidence.
4. Missing evidence is explicitly flagged and review_required is set when validation issues exist.
