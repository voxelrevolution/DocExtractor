# Evidence — T04.6.1_JD-DEV013_ExportUI

**Date:** 2026-01-19  
**Owner (JD):** DEV-013 (Full Stack Developer)

## Implementation Summary

- Implemented the Export UI panel that lists available invoice extractions and allows selecting one or more extractions for export.
- Wired the UI to the existing local API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/invoices/extractions?limit=50` (selection list)
  - `POST /api/invoices/export` (generates export rows)
- Added a CSV download action that converts the returned JSON rows into a client-side CSV file.
- Enforced local-only API usage in the UI (rejects non-local `VITE_API_BASE_URL`).
- Added client scoping to export requests to preserve `client_id` boundary.
