# Governance Model: Category Ownership & Change Control

**Task:** T02.4.1_JD-DATA024_DefineClassificationTaxonomy  
**Evidence Artifact:** Governance Framework  
**Created By:** DATA-024 (Ontology and Taxonomy Designer)  
**Date:** 2026-01-14

---

## Executive Summary

Each category has an owner responsible for definition, examples, and version control. Change process is formalized (v1.0 → v1.1 → v2.0). Versioning strategy ensures backward compatibility. No breaking changes without data migration plan.

```

### Minor Change (v1.x): Definition Clarification

**Trigger Examples:**
- Add additional examples to a category
- Clarify non-examples (ambiguity elimination)
- Update confidence threshold (e.g., from 0.85 → 0.87)
- Update LLM prompt hints

**Process:**
1. Category Owner submits change request (title, rationale, examples)
2. DATA-024 (Ontology Designer) reviews impact (no breaking changes)
3. Category Owner approves (1 day turnaround)
4. Update artifact and bump version: v1.0 → v1.1
5. Release same day to all classifiers

**Impact:** v1.1 classifications can coexist with v1.0 in database; backward compatible.

**Example:**
```
Change Request:
  From: "Invoice" defined as "Request for payment"
  To: "Invoice" defined as "Request for payment with itemized line items"
  Reason: Distinguish from demand letter (legal notice)
  Examples added: "(e.g., with purchase order number, unit prices, quantities)"
  
Approval: AP Lead (1 day)
Version bump: v1.0 → v1.1 (same taxonomy structure, enhanced definition)
Release: T02.4.2 uses v1.1 for future classifications
Migration: None (existing v1.0 docs remain v1.0; acceptable for low-priority)
```

### Standard Change (v1.x → v1.y): Moderate Scope

**Trigger Examples:**
- Add a new category (e.g., "Invoice Amendment")
- Remove a low-priority category (e.g., "Marketing" if not needed)
- Reorganize examples/non-examples for clarity
- Adjust compliance level (e.g., from Medium → High)

**Process:**
1. Category Owner + DATA-024 prepare change request
2. GC (Legal) reviews: any regulatory impact?
3. Stakeholders approve (5 days)
4. Migration plan created (if category removal)
5. Data migration script prepared (if needed)
6. Version bump: v1.0 → v1.3 or v1.5 (major.minor bumped)
7. Release within 1 week
8. Monitor existing classifications (legacy docs may need review)

**Example:**
```
Change Request:
  Add new category: "InvoiceAmendment" (variation of Invoice)
  Reason: Some vendors send amended invoices; easier to track separately
  Examples: "Invoice Revision 2", "Amendment to Invoice #12345"
  Confidence threshold: 0.85 (same as Invoice)
  
Reviews: AP Lead, GC, DATA-024 (5 days total)
Approval: Category Owner + GC
Version bump: v1.0 → v1.3
Migration: Not needed (new category only; existing Invoices stay as-is)
Release: 1 week from approval
```

### Major Change (v1.x → v2.0): Structural Overhaul

**Trigger Examples:**
- Remove a core domain (e.g., eliminate "Legal" domain, move to "Compliance")
- Reorganize taxonomy (flat → hierarchical)
- Rename categories (e.g., "Invoice" → "PurchaseInvoice" + "SalesInvoice")
- Merge domains (e.g., "Financial" + "Operations" → single domain)

**Process:**
1. Steering Committee proposes change (major impact)
2. All domain owners review (7 days)
3. GC and exec sponsor approve
4. Comprehensive migration plan created:
   - Mapping old categories → new categories
   - Retraining LLM on new taxonomy
   - Reclassification of existing documents (optional vs. required)
   - Rollback plan (if needed)
5. Data migration script written and tested
6. Version bump: v1.x → v2.0
7. Parallel classification (v1.0 and v2.0 run for 30 days)
8. Full migration over 2 weeks

**Example:**
```
Change Request (v1.0 → v2.0):
  Hierarchize taxonomy (flat → multi-level)
  New structure:
    ├─ Financial
    │  ├─ Payment Request (Invoice, PO, Quote)
    │  ├─ Payment Confirmation (Receipt, Statement)
    │  └─ Adjustments (Credit Memo, Debit Memo)
    └─ ...
  
Rationale: LLM v2 handles hierarchies better; enables advanced routing

Reviews: All domain owners + GC + CFO (7 days)
Approval: Steering Committee + exec sponsor

Migration Plan:
  Week 1-2: Parallel classification (v1.0 + v2.0)
  Week 3-4: Reclassify high-confidence v1.0 docs (>90%)
  Week 5: Manual review of medium-confidence (70-90%)
  Week 6: Cutover to v2.0 only (no more v1.0 classifications)
  Rollback: If accuracy drops below 85%, revert to v1.0

Data Migration:
  INSERT INTO document_classifications_v2 
  SELECT ... FROM document_classifications_v1 
  WHERE model_version = 'v1.0' AND confidence >= 0.90;
```

## Version Compatibility & Backward Compatibility

### Versioning Scheme

```
v1.0   v1.1   v1.2   v1.3   v1.5   v1.6              v2.0   v2.1
 │      │      │      │      │      │                 │      │
 │      │      │      │      │      │                 │      └─ Rollout
 │      │      │      │      │      └─ Rollout        │
 │      │      │      │      └─ Release               └─ Major structure change
 │      │      │      └─ Release (std change)
 │      │      └─ Release (minor clarification)
 │      └─ Release (minor clarification)
 └─ Initial release (32 categories, flat)

Minor (v1.x):     Clarification only; all v1.x versions compatible
Standard (v1.y):  Add/remove low-priority categories; mostly compatible
Major (v2.0):     Structural change; requires migration plan
```

### Database Versioning Strategy

```sql
-- Store classification with version
CREATE TABLE document_classifications (
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  doc_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
  category VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  confidence DECIMAL(3,2),
  model_version VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,  -- v1.0, v1.1, v2.0, etc.
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(doc_id, model_version)  -- One classification per doc per version
);

-- Query by version
SELECT * FROM document_classifications 
WHERE model_version = 'v1.0' AND category = 'Invoice';

-- Parallel classification during migration
SELECT * FROM document_classifications 
WHERE model_version IN ('v1.0', 'v2.0')
  AND confidence >= 0.90;

-- Aggregate statistics by version
SELECT model_version, category, COUNT(*) as count, AVG(confidence) as avg_conf
FROM document_classifications
GROUP BY model_version, category
ORDER BY model_version, category;
```

### Backward Compatibility Rules

| Change Type | v1.0 Docs Remain? | v1.0 Queries Work? | Compatibility |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| v1.0 → v1.1 (clarification) | YES | YES | 100% backward compatible |
| v1.0 → v1.3 (add category) | YES | YES | 100% backward compatible |
| v1.0 → v1.5 (remove low-priority) | YES | MAYBE | 95% (low-priority queries fail) |
| v1.0 → v2.0 (restructure) | MIGRATION | REQUIRES UPDATE | 50% (mapping needed) |
