## SECTION 2: TASK DEFINITION

### Objective (One Sentence)
Create the invoice extraction benchmark set and regression metrics with release gating criteria.

### Description
- Define field-level metrics (exact/normalized match).
- Design benchmark set with vendor and scan variability.
- Implement regression evaluation harness.
- Propose quality gates for critical fields.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Benchmark set specification documented.
- Metrics defined for critical fields and line items.
- Regression gate thresholds proposed.

### Assigned JD Role
**Role:** DATA-029 – Extraction Evaluation & QA Specialist (non-delegable)

### Dependencies (Blocking This Task)
- T03.1.1 schema definition completed.
- T03.2.1 extraction path available.

### Downstream Tasks (That This Unblocks)
- E03 final verification gate
