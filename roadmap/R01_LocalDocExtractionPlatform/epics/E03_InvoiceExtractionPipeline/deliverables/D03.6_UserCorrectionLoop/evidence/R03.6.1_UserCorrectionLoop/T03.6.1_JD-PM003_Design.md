## Correction Workflow
1. User reviews extracted invoice fields.
2. User submits corrections to `/api/invoices/corrections` as a list of `CorrectionInput` records.
3. Corrections stored with server-generated `id` and `created_at` timestamp.
4. Corrections retrievable via `/api/invoices/corrections` (optionally filtered by `extraction_id`).

## Review Triggers
- `review_required` is true when validation errors/warnings exist.
- Specific trigger reasons stored in `review_reasons`.

## Correction Capture Schema
Defined in `src/schemas/annotations.py`:
- `extraction_id` (optional)
- `field_name`
- `original_value`
- `corrected_value`
- `feedback_type` (correction/confirmation/error)
- `user_notes` (optional)

## Storage
In-memory list `_corrections` with sequential IDs.
