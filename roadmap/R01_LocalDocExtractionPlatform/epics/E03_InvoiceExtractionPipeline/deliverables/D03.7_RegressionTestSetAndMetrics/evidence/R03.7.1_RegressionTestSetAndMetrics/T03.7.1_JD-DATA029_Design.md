## Benchmark & Metrics Design
- Benchmark records stored as JSON with `extraction_id` and field values.
- Metrics computed for header fields and line items.
- Reports include per-field precision/recall and aggregate accuracy.

## Regression Gates
- Mean field accuracy and line-item accuracy tracked per run.
- Proposed thresholds set in evaluation summaries (to be finalized with QC).
