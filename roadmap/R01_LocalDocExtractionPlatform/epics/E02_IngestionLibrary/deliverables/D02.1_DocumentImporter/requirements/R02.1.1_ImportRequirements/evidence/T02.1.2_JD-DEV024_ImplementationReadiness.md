## Implementation Readiness Checklist

### Design Completeness

- [x] **Architecture documented** – All 6 modules specified with inputs/outputs
- [x] **Module interfaces clear** – Each module has well-defined contract
- [x] **Error handling strategy** – Every error scenario has mitigation
- [x] **Performance targets** – Per-module targets established and feasible
- [x] **Database schema** – Integration points with T02.3.1 identified
- [x] **Deployment model** – Local-only, Python, SQLite specified
- [x] **Configuration** – Config parameters documented

### Technical Decisions

- [x] **Libraries chosen** – pdfplumber, python-docx, SQLite with justification
- [x] **Parsing approach** – Sequential (not parallel) decided
- [x] **Error model** – Partial success (not all-or-nothing) decided
- [x] **Hash timing** – At import (not dedup time) decided
- [x] **Batch size** – 100 documents maximum decided
- [x] **Timeout** – 2 seconds per document decided
- [x] **Storage model** – Per-document transactional commits decided

### Dependencies Resolved

- [x] **T02.3.1 blocking** – Explicit dependency on schema design
- [x] **D02.2 integration** – Hash computation sequenced for dedup
- [x] **D02.4 integration** – Document storage ready for classification
- [x] **D02.5 integration** – Metadata table ready for tagging

### Risk Mitigation

- [x] **9 risks identified** – From large PDFs to memory leaks
- [x] **Mitigations planned** – File size checks, context managers, WAL mode, etc.
- [x] **Ownership assigned** – Each risk has responsible party
- [x] **Monitoring strategy** – Logging, audit trail, performance tracking

### Code Readiness

**Estimated implementation effort:** 40-60 hours (DEV-024, T02.1.3)

**Modules to implement (in order):**
1. Batch Validator (simplest, ~60 lines)
2. PDF Parser (using pdfplumber, ~80 lines)
3. DOCX Parser (using python-docx, ~80 lines)
4. Hash Module (using hashlib, ~30 lines)
5. Storage Module (SQLite operations, ~100 lines)
6. Batch Orchestrator (coordinator, ~150 lines)

**Total estimated code:** ~500 lines Python

**Library dependencies to install:**
- `pdfplumber` – PDF parsing
- `python-docx` – DOCX parsing
- `psutil` – Memory monitoring (optional but recommended)
- `sqlite3` – Included with Python

### Testing Readiness

**Unit tests required (for T02.1.4):**
- [ ] Batch Validator: valid batch, too many docs, unsupported type
- [ ] PDF Parser: normal PDF, corrupted PDF, timeout scenario
- [ ] DOCX Parser: normal DOCX, corrupted DOCX, complex tables
- [ ] Hash Module: consistent hashing, performance < 50ms
- [ ] Storage Module: insert success, transaction rollback, unique constraints
- [ ] Batch Orchestrator: partial success, error aggregation

**Integration tests required:**
- [ ] End-to-end: 10-doc batch imports successfully
- [ ] Error handling: 1 invalid doc in batch continues
- [ ] Performance: Batch of 100 completes < 60 seconds
- [ ] Data integrity: Audit log matches imports

**Test data needed:**
- 5 sample PDFs (small, medium, large, corrupted, complex formatting)
- 5 sample DOCX files (simple, complex tables, corrupted)
- Performance test data (100 diverse documents)

### Deployment Readiness

- [x] **Local-only** – No cloud infrastructure needed
- [x] **Python environment** – Python 3.10+, pip for dependencies
- [x] **Database** – SQLite (file-based, no setup needed)
- [x] **Configuration** – Config parameters documented
- [x] **Error messages** – User-friendly error handling specified

### Sign-Off Readiness

**For QC-101 review (T02.1.4):**
- [x] Architecture Design document (this artifact chain)
- [x] Design Review (approval by DEV-024)
- [x] Decision Log (all decisions documented + justified)
- [x] Technical Risks (9 risks with mitigations)
- [x] Implementation Readiness (this document)
- [ ] Code implementation (DEV-024 T02.1.3)
- [ ] Unit test results (QC-101 T02.1.4)
- [ ] Integration test results (QC-101 T02.1.4)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks (QC-101 T02.1.4)
- [ ] QC-101 Sign-Off (QC-101 T02.1.4)

## Start Checklist for T02.1.3 (Implementation)

**Before DEV-024 begins coding:**

1. [ ] Confirm T02.3.1 (Schema Design) is complete
   - Verify documents, hash_index, audit_log tables are designed
   - Confirm column names and data types

2. [ ] Prepare test data
   - 5 sample PDFs of varying sizes
   - 5 sample DOCX files of varying complexity
   - 1 corrupted PDF for error testing
   - 1 corrupted DOCX for error testing

3. [ ] Set up development environment
   - Python 3.10+ installed
   - Create virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
   - Install dependencies: `pip install pdfplumber python-docx psutil`

4. [ ] Review architecture design
   - Read ArchitectureDesign.md
   - Understand all 6 modules and their interfaces

5. [ ] Review decision log
   - Understand why sequential (not parallel) parsing
   - Understand why per-document commits (not batch)
   - Understand timeout (2 seconds) and batch size (100 docs)

6. [ ] Review risks and mitigations
   - Large PDF timeout → file size check
   - Memory leak → context managers
   - Schema missing → startup validation
   - etc.

## Estimated Timeline

| Phase | Task | Effort | Blocker |
|-------|------|--------|---------|
| Design (T02.1.2) | ✅ COMPLETE | 8 hrs | None (complete now) |
| Implementation (T02.1.3) | IN QUEUE | 40-60 hrs | T02.3.1 schema |
| Testing (T02.1.4) | NOT STARTED | 20-30 hrs | T02.1.3 complete |
| **Total D02.1** | **—** | **68-98 hrs** | **—** |

**Critical dependency:** T02.3.1 (Schema Design) must complete before T02.1.3 can start.
