# T03.1.1_JD-PM003_ScopingReport

## Scope
Define the canonical invoice schema and field definitions for MVP extraction, including evidence requirements per field. This is the authoritative schema for E03 and downstream export/evaluation.

## In Scope
- Header fields: vendor, invoice_number, invoice_date, subtotal, tax, total
- Line item fields: description, quantity, unit_price, amount
- Evidence pointer requirements per field
- Review/validation metadata fields

## Out of Scope
- Contract or statement extraction
- Entity resolution
- External system integrations

## Dependencies
- E01 core schemas and governance complete
- E02 ingestion pipeline delivering text + metadata

## Risks
- Field normalization ambiguity (date formats, currency symbols)
- Inconsistent evidence granularity across OCR vs PDF text

## Mitigations
- Normalize dates and currency where possible
- Explicitly allow null evidence with review flags
