# T01.1.6 – External Onboarding Test (Non-Author Validation)

## Task Context
**Assigned to:** QC-101 (QA Engineer)  
**Associated Requirement:** R01.1 (Dev Environment Reproducibility)  
**Status:** Not Started  
**JD Reference:** `/Setup/fiab/agents/job_descriptions/QC-101_QA_Engineer.json`

## Task Statement
Have a team member who was not involved in creating the setup artifacts follow the onboarding docs and setup script independently. This validates that the docs and scripts are clear and complete enough for someone unfamiliar with the project.

## Test Procedure
1. **Get Fresh Environment** – Clone repo on a machine or VM clean of any project setup
2. **Read Onboarding Doc** – Follow `docs/ONBOARDING.md` exactly
3. **Execute Setup** – Run `./scripts/setup.sh` and let it complete
4. **Verify Services** – Confirm PostgreSQL, Ollama, Python venv all work
5. **Run Tests** – Execute pytest and confirm all tests pass
6. **Provide Feedback** – Document any confusion, errors, or improvements needed

## Testing Scope
- [ ] Tester has never seen the project before
- [ ] Tester follows docs step-by-step (no ad-hoc troubleshooting without asking)
- [ ] All output and errors captured
- [ ] Feedback recorded in detail (what was confusing? what worked? what failed?)
- [ ] Time measured from start to "ready to develop"

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Setup completes without tester having to ask questions
- [ ] All services are verified and working
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Time to completion is <30 minutes
- [ ] Documentation is clear enough that tester felt confident
- [ ] Tester signs off: "I can now develop on this project"

## Feedback & Issues
If tester encounters any issues:
- [ ] Document exact error message
- [ ] Note what step in onboarding was unclear
- [ ] Provide suggestion for fix
- [ ] Do not fix issues yourself; escalate to DEV-024

## Evidence & Sign-Off
- [ ] Tester provides written feedback report (template below)
- [ ] Full execution log (setup.log)
- [ ] Screenshots of successful final state
- [ ] Signed confirmation: "Setup is reproducible and onboarding docs are clear"

### Feedback Report Template
```
## External Onboarding Test Report

**Tester:** [Name]  
**Date:** [Date]  
**Time to Completion:** [X minutes]  

### What Worked Well

### Overall Assessment
Setup is reproducible? **YES / NO**  
Onboarding docs are clear? **YES / NO**  

### Tester Sign-Off
I have successfully set up the development environment following the provided documentation.  
Signed: [Name] – [Date]
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] External test completed
- [ ] Feedback report submitted
- [ ] Evidence saved to `evidence/T01.1.6_external_test/`
- [ ] All issues from feedback are either:
  - Fixed in setup script/docs (escalate to relevant task owners)
  - Or documented as known issues with workarounds
- [ ] External tester signs off
- [ ] DEV-024 approves R01.1 completion

## Related Tasks
- Depends on T01.1.5 (internal test must pass first)
- Final step before R01.1 is marked complete
