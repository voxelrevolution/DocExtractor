# T01.1.4 – Create docs/ONBOARDING.md (Detailed Walkthrough)

## Task Context
**Assigned to:** PM-001 (Scoping Agent)  
**Associated Requirement:** R01.1 (Dev Environment Reproducibility)  
**Status:** Not Started  
**JD Reference:** `/Setup/fiab/agents/job_descriptions/PM-001_Scoping_Agent.json`

## Task Statement
Create comprehensive onboarding documentation (`docs/ONBOARDING.md`) that guides a non-technical or new engineer through the entire setup process. This document is the "single source of truth" for getting started.

## Documentation Structure

### 1. Prerequisites Section
- OS support (Linux, macOS, Windows + WSL2)
- Hardware requirements (GPU recommended, CPU OK for small batches)
- Minimum disk space (50GB for Ollama model + DB)
- Required software (Python 3.11+, Docker, Git)
- Ollama installation link

### 2. Quick Start (5-minute path)
```
1. Clone repo
2. cd into repo
3. Run ./scripts/setup.sh
4. Done!
```

### 3. Detailed Setup Walkthrough
- Step 1: Clone repository
- Step 2: Verify Python version
- Step 3: Review `.env.example`
- Step 4: Run setup script with explanation of what it does
- Step 5: Verify each service (PostgreSQL, Ollama, Python)
- Step 6: Run smoke tests

### 4. Verification Steps
- How to check PostgreSQL is running
- How to verify Ollama model is loaded
- How to run basic tests
- How to check all dependencies

### 5. Troubleshooting
| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `python3: command not found` | Python not installed | Install Python 3.11+ |
| `PostgreSQL connection refused` | Docker not running | Start Docker daemon |
| `Ollama model not found` | Model not downloaded | Run `ollama pull mixtral` |
| `Permission denied` on setup.sh | Not executable | `chmod +x scripts/setup.sh` |

### 6. Next Steps
- Running tests
- Starting the API server
- Accessing the UI
- Reading developer guides

### 7. FAQ
- "How do I uninstall everything?" (docker-compose down, rm -rf venv)
- "How do I reset the database?" (DROP DATABASE, re-init)
- "Can I use a different OS?" (document OS-specific workarounds)

## Content Guidelines
- Use clear, non-technical language where possible
- Include screenshots/GIFs of successful setup
- Provide copy-pasteable commands with explanations
- Highlight common mistakes and how to avoid them
- Link to relevant external docs (Python, Docker, PostgreSQL, Ollama)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Document is complete and covers all setup steps
- [ ] Clear and accessible to someone unfamiliar with the project
- [ ] All commands are tested and working
- [ ] Troubleshooting section covers the 5 most common issues
- [ ] Document is <5000 words (concise but comprehensive)
- [ ] Links to related docs are current and correct

## Definition of Done
- [ ] `docs/ONBOARDING.md` created and committed
- [ ] README.md updated with link to onboarding
- [ ] Document tested by at least one non-author (see T01.1.6)
- [ ] Feedback from external tester incorporated
- [ ] DEV-024 confirms acceptance

## Related Tasks
- Depends on T01.1.1, T01.1.2, T01.1.3 (setup must be working)
- Enables T01.1.6 (external validation)
- Should reference all setup artifacts
