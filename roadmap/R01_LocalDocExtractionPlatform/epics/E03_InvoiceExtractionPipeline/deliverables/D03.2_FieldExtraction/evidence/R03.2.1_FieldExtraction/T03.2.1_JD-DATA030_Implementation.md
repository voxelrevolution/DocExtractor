# T03.2.1_JD-DATA030_Implementation

## Summary
Implemented LLM-based invoice extraction with schema-constrained JSON parsing, bounded repair loop, and deterministic fallback.

## Files
- src/extraction/invoice_pipeline.py

- Prompt version tracked in `_PROMPT_VERSION`.
- JSON extraction and repair handled by `_extract_json` and `_repair_json`.
- Fallback to `extract_invoice_fields` when LLM path fails.
