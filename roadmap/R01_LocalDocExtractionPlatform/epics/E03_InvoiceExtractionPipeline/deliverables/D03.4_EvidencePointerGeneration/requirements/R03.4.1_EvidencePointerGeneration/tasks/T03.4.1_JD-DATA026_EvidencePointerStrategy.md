## SECTION 2: TASK DEFINITION

### Objective (One Sentence)
Define and implement evidence pointer standards covering page, line, and source for all extracted fields.

### Description
- Define evidence pointer schema for text and OCR sources.
- Ensure provenance coverage for header fields and line items.
- Document evidence resolution rules and limitations.
- Provide UI-friendly evidence snippets and identifiers.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Evidence pointers present for all extracted fields.
- Evidence includes page/line/source metadata when available.
- Missing evidence produces explicit nulls and review flags.

### Assigned JD Role
**Role:** DATA-026 – Document Intelligence Engineer (non-delegable)

### Dependencies (Blocking This Task)
- T03.2.1 LLM extraction path available.

### Downstream Tasks (That This Unblocks)
- T03.5.1 validation and error handling
- T03.7.1 regression evaluation
