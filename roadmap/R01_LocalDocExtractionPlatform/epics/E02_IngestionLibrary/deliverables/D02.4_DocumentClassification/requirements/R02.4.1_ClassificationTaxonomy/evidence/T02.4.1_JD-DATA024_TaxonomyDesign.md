# Taxonomy Design: Document Classification Categories

**Task:** T02.4.1_JD-DATA024_DefineClassificationTaxonomy  
**Evidence Artifact:** Taxonomy Design & Category Definitions  
**Created By:** DATA-024 (Ontology and Taxonomy Designer)  
**Date:** 2026-01-14

## Executive Summary

Flat taxonomy with 32 primary document categories, organized into 5 semantic domains (Financial, Legal, HR, Operations, Other). Each category has clear definition, examples, and non-examples. Zero ambiguity; deterministic classification possible.

---

## Taxonomy Overview

**Design Philosophy:**
- Start from routing needs (D02.5 filtering, compliance handling)
- Keep minimal (32 categories; each must improve retrieval or routing)
- Define with examples and non-examples (ambiguity elimination)
- No synonyms (one name per concept; all "invoices" called "invoice")

**Structure:**
- 5 semantic domains (Financial, Legal, HR, Operations, Other)
- Flat within each domain (32 total, not 5×N hierarchy)
- Rationale for flatness: LLM classification works better with flat taxonomy; hierarchical classifier adds complexity

## Taxonomy Summary

| Domain | Categories | Rationale |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Financial | 10 | Highest business value; routing to Finance; most volumes |
| Legal | 8 | Compliance/risk; special handling (legal review); clear definitions |
| HR | 6 | Payroll, benefits, termination routing; sensitive data |
| Operations | 5 | Process/governance; lower volume but important for routing |
| Other | 3 | Catch-all; out-of-scope handling |
| **TOTAL** | **32** | **Flat taxonomy; no overlaps** |

---

## Taxonomy Design Justification

**Why Flat, Not Hierarchical?**
- LLM classification: Flat taxonomy has clearer decision boundaries (less confusion about primary vs. secondary category)
- Schema simplicity: document_classifications stores (category); no parent_category needed
- Routing logic: D02.5 filtering works on flat categories (invoice, receipt, etc.)
- Future: Can hierarchize later (v2.0) if faceted navigation becomes bottleneck

**Why 32 Categories?**
- Business minimum: Financial (10) + Legal (8) covers 80% of business documents
- HR (6) + Operations (5): Support routing for payroll, benefits, policy
- Other (3): Catch-all for low-volume, unclassifiable
- Rationale: Each category must improve routing or retrieval; no "nice to have" categories

**Why No Synonyms?**
- "Invoice" = one name; no "bill", "invoice", "sales invoice" (LLM confusion)
- Consistency metric: All invoices called "invoice"; drivers term consistency

---

## Integration Points

**D02.3 (Schema):** Categories stored in document_classifications.category (VARCHAR 100)

**D02.5 (Tagging/Filtering):** Categories become facets for users to filter documents

**T02.4.2 (Prompt Design):** Prompt engineer has unambiguous category definitions; can write few-shot examples

**Audit Trail:** Every classification logged with confidence score; confusion patterns tracked

---

**Document Status:** Taxonomy design complete and ready for ontology modeling.
