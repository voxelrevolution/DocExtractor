# Implementation Status (MVP): Document Classification v1

**Requirement:** R02.4.1 – Classification Taxonomy

## What Is Implemented

The ingestion stack currently ships a minimal, deterministic classification used for mixed-document ingestion:

- `invoice`
- `other`

This classification is used to:

- Route invoice-like documents into the invoice extraction pipeline.
- Store non-invoice documents with a short excerpt for corpus context and chat citations.

## Where It Lives (Code)

- Classifier: `src/ingestion/classification.py`
- Ingest API: `src/main.py` (`POST /api/documents/ingest`)
- Persistence (optional): `src/database/sqlite_store.py` stores `doc_type` and `text_excerpt`

## Why This Is Intentionally Minimal

The taxonomy design artifacts under this requirement define a broader, future-facing taxonomy (e.g., receipts, contracts, statements). The shipped implementation is intentionally scoped to `invoice` vs `other` to unblock:

- Mixed-corpus ingestion
- Document listing/retrieval APIs
- Corpus chat citations for non-invoice documents

Expanding from `invoice`/`other` to the full taxonomy is a follow-on implementation step.

## Test Evidence

Classification behavior and ingest routing are covered by automated tests:

- `tests/test_document_ingest.py`
- `tests/test_documents_api.py`

A full run of the test suite currently passes.
