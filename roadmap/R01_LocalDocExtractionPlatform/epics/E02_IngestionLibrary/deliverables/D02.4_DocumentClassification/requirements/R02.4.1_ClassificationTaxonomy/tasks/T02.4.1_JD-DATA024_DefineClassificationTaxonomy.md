## SECTION 2: TASK DEFINITION

### Objective

**Design a document classification taxonomy that is simple, unambiguous, and maintainable. Enable precise document routing, filtering, and retrieval. Specification ready for prompt implementation (T02.4.2).**

### Context

From D02.1 (Import):
- Documents: PDF, DOCX, images, text
- Volume: up to 1000 docs/batch
- Sources: local filesystem, batch imports

From D02.3 (Schema):
- Classifications stored in document_classifications table (category, confidence, model_version)
- Unique constraint: one classification per doc per model per category

From D02.5 (Tagging):
- Tags used for manual organization; classifications enable automated routing
- Faceted navigation: users filter by document type/category

### Description

Design a classification taxonomy that answers:

1. **What Are the Document Categories?**
   - Start from routing and retrieval needs (not arbitrary categories)
   - Define 20-50 primary categories (invoice, receipt, contract, purchase order, statement, etc.)
   - Each category must have clear definition (what documents belong, what don't)
   - Include non-examples (what looks similar but isn't)
   - Ensure no ambiguity (classifier can make deterministic decisions)

2. **Is There a Hierarchy or Facets?**
   - Flat taxonomy vs. hierarchical (e.g., FinancialDocuments > Invoice, Receipt, Statement)
   - Facets: Can a document have multiple facets (e.g., "Confidential" + "Invoice")?
   - Scope: Should we classify by content type (Invoice), source (Supplier), or both?

3. **How Does This Enable Routing?**
   - D02.5 (Tagging): Classifications enable filtering (show all invoices)
   - Search: Facets improve discoverability
   - Compliance: Some categories get special handling (contracts require legal review)

4. **What Are the Success Criteria?**
   - Routing precision: LLM classifier achieves 90%+ accuracy on test set
   - Term consistency: No synonym chaos (invoice vs. bill vs. invoice)
   - Maintainability: Clear owners, versioned, change-controlled

5. **What's the Governance Model?**
   - Who owns each category? (e.g., Finance owns Invoice category)
   - How do categories evolve? (proposal → review → approval → deploy)
   - How are changes communicated? (change log, migration guide)
   - Backward compatibility: If we rename "Receipt" → "Sales Receipt", what happens to existing tags?

6. **How Will This Integrate Downstream?**
   - T02.4.2: LLM prompt implementation (prompt must be unambiguous)
   - D02.3: Schema (document_classifications table)
   - D02.5: Faceted filtering (users see categories as filters)
   - Audit trail: Classifications logged, searchable

## SECTION 3: ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (8 Gates)

### Gate 1: Taxonomy Completeness & Clarity

**Question:** Is taxonomy well-defined with no ambiguity?

**Acceptance:**
- [x] 20-50 document categories defined
- [x] Each category has clear definition (what documents belong, what don't)
- [x] Non-examples provided for ambiguous categories (e.g., "Receipt" vs. "Invoice")
- [x] No overlapping categories (a document belongs in exactly one primary category)
- [x] Category names are consistent, unambiguous, domain-appropriate

**Sign-Off:** DATA-024 certifies taxonomy is simple and maintainable.

### Gate 2: Semantic Model (Ontology) Defined

**Question:** Are relationships between categories understood?

**Acceptance:**
- [x] Hierarchy documented (if applicable): financial vs. legal vs. operational
- [x] Facets defined (if applicable): can classifications be combined?
- [x] Semantic relationships clear (e.g., "Invoice" is a type of "Financial Document")
- [x] No inference needed: relationships are explicit, not derived

**Sign-Off:** DATA-024 confirms ontology is sound.

### Gate 3: Routing & Filtering Logic

**Question:** Does taxonomy enable the downstream use cases?

**Acceptance:**
- [x] D02.5 tagging: Categories map to user-facing filters
- [x] Search facets: Categories enable efficient filtering (< 100ms per facet query)
- [x] Compliance routing: High-value categories (contracts, legal) identified
- [x] Error handling: Out-of-scope documents have clear routing ("Other" category)

**Sign-Off:** All downstream teams (D02.5, search) confirm routing clarity.

### Gate 4: Governance & Versioning

**Question:** Is governance model sustainable long-term?

**Acceptance:**
- [x] Category owners identified (who owns "Invoice" category? Finance owner)
- [x] Change process documented (proposal → review → approval → deploy)
- [x] Versioning scheme defined (v1.0 → v1.1 → v2.0)
- [x] Backward compatibility plan: how do we rename or delete categories?
- [x] Change log template provided (for documenting changes)

**Sign-Off:** DATA-024 confirms governance is maintainable.

### Gate 5: Success Metrics & Evaluation

**Question:** How will we know taxonomy is working?

**Acceptance:**
- [x] Routing precision metric: 90%+ LLM accuracy on test set
- [x] Term consistency metric: No synonym chaos (all "invoices" called "invoice")
- [x] Retrieval quality metric: Users can find documents by category
- [x] Maintenance burden metric: Change approval time < 1 week
- [x] Test plan: Evaluation dataset with ground truth labels per category

**Sign-Off:** QC-101 confirms metrics are measurable.

### Gate 6: Migration & Backward Compatibility

**Question:** Can we deploy this without breaking downstream systems?

**Acceptance:**
- [x] Mapping from old taxonomy to new (if applicable)
- [x] Existing classified documents remain valid (no lost history)
- [x] Category rename/delete plan (e.g., "Receipt" → "Sales Receipt" mapping)
- [x] Rollback strategy documented (can we revert to v1.0 if needed?)

**Sign-Off:** DATA-024 confirms migration is safe.

### Gate 7: Integration with T02.4.2 (Prompt Design)

**Question:** Is taxonomy ready for prompt implementation?

**Acceptance:**
- [x] Category definitions are unambiguous (prompt engineer can write prompt without asking questions)
- [x] Examples provided for each category (few-shot prompting requires examples)
- [x] Confidence thresholds defined (when is a classification "confident"?)
- [x] Error handling explicit (low confidence, out-of-scope handling)
- [x] JSON output schema defined (prompt must output valid JSON with category, confidence)

**Sign-Off:** T02.4.2 team confirms spec is implementation-ready.

### Gate 8: QC-101 Approval

**Question:** Does taxonomy meet all gates and pass final review?

**Acceptance:**
- [x] Taxonomy is complete, clear, and maintainable
- [x] Ontology and relationships are sound
- [x] Routing/filtering logic enables downstream use cases
- [x] Governance and versioning plan is explicit
- [x] Success metrics are measurable and realistic
- [x] Migration and backward compatibility planned
- [x] Integration with T02.4.2 validated
- [x] No blockers for prompt implementation

**Sign-Off:** QC-101 certifies taxonomy ready for implementation.

## SECTION 4: ASSIGNED JOB DESCRIPTION

**Role:** DATA-024 (Ontology and Taxonomy Designer)

**World-Class Behaviors Applied to This Task:**

1. **Model with Intent** – Start from routing and retrieval needs (D02.5 filtering, D02.3 schema); keep taxonomy minimal and unambiguous; define terms with examples and non-examples.

2. **Governance Built-In** – Define owners per category; establish change process (proposal → review → approval); maintain versioning and backward-compatible mappings; publish change logs.

3. **Systems Thinking** – Understand how taxonomy integrates with upstream (D02.1 imports, D02.3 schema), downstream (D02.5 filtering, T02.4.2 prompts), and governance.

4. **Stakeholder Facilitation** – Align Finance on Invoice definition, align Legal on Contract definition; document trade-offs (granularity vs. maintainability).

5. **Semantic Clarity** – Eliminate synonym chaos (invoice vs. bill); define relationships (financial documents hierarchy); ensure prompt engineer has no questions about category boundaries.
