## Architecture Quality Assessment

### Coherence: ✅ STRONG
- All 5 evidence artifacts reinforce each other
- No contradictions or gaps
- Decisions build logically (definition → detection → handling → governance)

### Completeness: ✅ COMPREHENSIVE
- Definition unambiguous (SHA-256, byte-for-byte)
- Detection method justified (comparative analysis)
- Handling clear (reject duplicates, audit trail)
- Governance explicit (system authority, escalation paths)
- Performance validated (< 10ms lookups achievable)

### Technical Soundness: ✅ STRONG
- SHA-256 is cryptographically solid choice
- UNIQUE index on hash_index ensures correctness
- Immutable audit trail meets compliance
- Performance model realistic (tested assumptions)

### Alignment with E02: ✅ PERFECT
- Integrates with T02.1.2 (hash computed at import time)
- Supports T02.3.1 (schema defined for hash_index)
- No conflicts with D02.1, D02.4, D02.5
- Can start independently (no blockers)

### Governance & Compliance: ✅ EXCELLENT
- Immutable audit trail documented
- Authority matrix clear (system → deterministic)
- Escalation paths explicit (admin, DEV-003, PM-007)
- No ambiguity on "who decides"

## DoD Gate Validation

### Gate 1: Requirements Covered

**Question:** Are all acceptance criteria from T02.1.1 addressed?

**Answer:** ✅ YES
- "What constitutes a duplicate?" → Byte-for-byte via SHA-256
- "How to detect?" → Hash lookup in hash_index
- "What to do?" → Reject and log
- "Audit trail?" → Immutable audit_log table
- "Performance?" → < 10ms lookups, validated

### Gate 2: Technical Design Sound

**Question:** Are there flaws, risks, or missing considerations?

**Answer:** ✅ NO BLOCKING ISSUES
- Risks identified and mitigated (collision rate negligible)
- Performance model validated
- Schema is correct
- Governance is explicit

### Gate 3: Implementation-Ready

**Question:** Can T02.2.2 (DEV-003) implement from this spec?

**Answer:** ✅ YES
- Algorithm: SHA-256 (clear)
- Schema: hash_index table (defined)
- Query pattern: Deterministic lookup (simple)
- Performance target: < 10ms (explicit)
- Error handling: Immutable audit trail (well-defined)

### Gate 4: Integration Points Clear

**Question:** Are dependencies and handoff points identified?

**Answer:** ✅ YES
- Upstream: T02.1.2 computes hash at import
- Downstream: T02.2.2 implements the hash lookup
- Schema: T02.3.1 must define hash_index table
- No surprises for implementation team

### Gate 5: Governance Aligned

**Question:** Is authority clear? Are escalation paths explicit?

**Answer:** ✅ YES
- System is deterministic (no human judgment)
- Admin has override path (future feature)
- Audit trail enables accountability
- No ambiguity

### Gate 6: No Tech Debt

**Question:** Will this design cause problems later?

**Answer:** ✅ UNLIKELY
- SHA-256 secure for 20+ years (no near-term risk)
- Architecture scales to 100M+ documents
- Immutable audit trail is gold standard (no upgrades needed)
- One future consideration: BLAKE3 for performance (not urgent)

## Minor Observations (Non-Blocking)

**Observation 1:** Future Override Feature
- **Note:** GovernanceFramework.md mentions future override feature
- **Status:** Not in E02 scope (good)
- **Action:** Document in E06 planning

**Observation 2:** Long-Term Hash Migration
- **Note:** HashStrategyDocument.md mentions potential BLAKE3 migration
- **Status:** Not urgent (SHA-256 secure for 20+ years)
- **Action:** Add to year-5+ roadmap review

**Observation 3:** Duplicate Rate Monitoring**
- **Note:** PerformanceModel.md includes alert threshold (> 50%)
- **Status:** Good proactive approach
- **Action:** Implement monitoring in T02.2.3

## Approval Decision

**APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION ✅**

T02.2.1 deduplication architecture is comprehensive, well-justified, and technically sound. All acceptance criteria met. No blocking issues.

**Ready for:**
- T02.2.2 (DEV-003 Design Hash Algorithm) – can start immediately
- T02.2.3 (DEV-003 Implement) – can start when T02.2.2 + T02.3.1 complete
- T02.2.4 (QC-101 Testing) – can start when T02.2.3 complete
