# T03.4.1_JD-DATA026_Implementation

## Summary
Implemented explicit evidence-pointer handling for invoice extraction fields. When a field has no detected evidence, a placeholder evidence pointer is created with `source="missing"` and an explanatory message. Validation now flags missing evidence for populated fields and records review reasons.

## Files Updated
- src/extraction/invoice.py

## Notes
- Evidence pointers are now guaranteed for all invoice header fields (`vendor`, `invoice_number`, `invoice_date`, `subtotal`, `tax`, `total`).
- Missing evidence is explicitly identified and surfaced in `validation_warnings` and `review_reasons`.
